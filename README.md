## Introduction

Hello everyone! I am thrilled to announce that I have secured a Data Analyst Internship at Psyliq. I’ve been tasked with an exciting challenge — an Pharma Data Analysis Assessment comprising 17 questions.

## Datasets

**Pharma_data:** It contains information about the  medicines. It has 2,54,082 rows and 18 columns.


## ad_hoc_request

1. Basic Filtering: Can you filter the data to show only the records for a specific country, let's 
say "United States"?
2. Sorting Data: How would you sort the data in ascending order based on the "Sales" 
column?
3. Summarizing Data: What is the total quantity of all products sold in the year 2023?
4. Conditional Formatting: Apply conditional formatting to highlight all sales greater than 
$5,000 in the "Sales" column.
5. Simple Pivot Table: Create a pivot table to summarize total sales by "Channel."
6. Basic Chart: Generate a bar chart to visualize the sales quantity by "Product Class."
7. VLOOKUP Function: Can you use the VLOOKUP function to find the "Manager" for a 
specific "Sales Rep"?
8. Data Validation: Set up data validation to allow only specific cities from a predefined list in 
the "City" column.
9. Advanced Filtering: Apply a filter to show records where "Product Class" is either 
"Electronics" or "Clothing."
10. Sorting with Multiple Criteria: How would you sort the data first by "Country" in 
ascending order, and then by "Month" in descending order?
11. Calculated Fields in Pivot Table: Add a calculated field in the pivot table to calculate the 
average price per unit sold.
12. Advanced Charting: Create a line chart to show the trend of total sales over the years.
13. Nested IF Function: Use a nested IF function to categorize "Sales" into three categories: 
Low, Medium, and High.
14. Data Validation with Dropdown Lists: Create dropdown lists for "Product Class" and 
"Sub-channel" in the data entry cells.

15. Pivot Chart: Turn the pivot table created earlier into a pivot chart to visualize sales by 
"Distributor."
16. Pivot Table Slicers: Add slicers to the pivot table to allow easy filtering by "Month" and 
"Year."
17. Lookup Functions: Use INDEX and MATCH functions to find the "Sales Rep" for a specific 
"Customer Name."
